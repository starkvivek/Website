This HTML code creates a simple role-based login system with the following features:

1. Login functionality: Users can enter their username and password to log in.
2. Role-based dashboard: After successful login, the dashboard displays a welcome message and role-specific information.
3. Admin and user roles: The code includes two predefined users with different roles (admin and user).
4. Logout functionality: A logout button is displayed on the dashboard, allowing users to log out and return to the login page.

However, please note that:

1. Security concerns: Storing passwords in plain text (like in the users array) is a significant security risk. In a real-world application, passwords should be hashed and stored securely.
2. Limited functionality: This code is a basic example and might not cover all edge cases or include additional features you might need.
